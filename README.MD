Gameplay:

User controls a 'robot' which exists within a map and faces off against enemy robots. Leaving this map will incur damage.

The user's robot is controlled with WASD -- and enemy robots will be fired by the user's laser when the enemy robot is within range of the user's laser. 

The robots also have a laser, but with shorter range. So maintaining a healthy distance away from enemy robots will be key, and avoiding getting entangled with multiple robots at one time will also be key.

Victory Condition: 101 enemy Robots are defeated (health< 0)

Loss Condition: Player's Robots are defeated (health < 0)

Enemy Robots will feed into the map -- some are able to track the player's robots, others bounce around aimlessly. 

The user's robot can 'teleport' from its current point on the map to any other point -- every several seconds. Watch the yellow status bar in the top left to see when this ability has fully recharged!
